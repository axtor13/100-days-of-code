# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8th 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spend 3/4 of my programming hours trying to stablish two github accounts in one computer. In the process I've learned:

- How to configure SSH public and privae keys gor your accounts.
- Create files with only extension (e.g .git, .gitconfig)


**Thoughts:** I actually struggled a lot configuring Git and Github together, that complex of myself trying to get everything right 'til gets down but fortunately this little piece of knowledge will help a lot through the future
